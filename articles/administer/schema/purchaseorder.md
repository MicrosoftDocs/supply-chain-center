# **PurchaseOrder**

Purchase orders are used in relatively simple transactions where minimal negotiations are required between the buyer and seller or where an existing agreement is in place. The seller states that products can be ordered with a purchase order. The Purchase Order is an offer to the seller to contract on the terms offered and any such offer specifically limits acceptance by seller to the terms defined.

A Purchase Order is a contract between the buyer and seller that specifies the items to be purchased, price and date that the goods or services will be delivered. The PO may also contain terms of purchase (STANDARD TERMS & CONDITIONS), specifications and quality levels. It is the legal agreement between the buyer and supplier and the reference point for measuring supplier performance. Changes to the Purchase Order may be made several points, PO Change Order (PURCHASING), and must be maintained for audit purposes.
