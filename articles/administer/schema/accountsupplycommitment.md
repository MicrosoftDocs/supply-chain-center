# **AccountSupplyCommitment**

The account supply commitment pertains to the assurance or undertaking made by suppliers regarding a purchase order. Suppliers guarantee specific ship dates, delivery dates, and quantities they are capable of delivering. If customers permit partial shipments, suppliers can furnish a delivery schedule that includes multiple promised ship dates and quantities associated with those purchase order schedules.
