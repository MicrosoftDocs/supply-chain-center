# Data schema

Microsoft Supply Chain Center’s schema is based on the [Azure Synapse Database Templates schema](/azure/synapse-analytics/database-designer/overview-database-templates), which is a large set of schemas that span multiple industry verticals, including freight and logistics. Supply Chain Center’s schema is a representation of all supply chain process areas, such as Procurement, Sales, Warehouse and Distribution, Freight and Logistics, Production or Manufacturing, and Planning and Forecasting. It includes all normalized entities, based on industry standards, to help our customers build a powerful control tower or supply chain network.

For a list of entities, attributes, and their descriptions, contact Support to request a copy of the Data Schema document.
