You can view which environment you're currently using within the header of Microsoft Supply Chain Center. Some companies may use multiple environments within a tenant for Supply Chain Center. For more information, see [Sign up for a free trial](../get-started/free-trial.md).

Select the environment name to expand a panel on the right and shows all Supply Chain Center environments you have access to.

> - Dataverse environments with the Supply Chain Center trial installed.
> - Supply Chain Center environments that you are added to as a user.

For more information on how to add users to your Supply Chain Center environment, see [Add users](add-users.md). By default, these environments are named “Microsoft Supply Chain Center Trial”. You can rename environments using the Microsoft Power Platform admin center.
