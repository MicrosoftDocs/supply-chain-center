# Environment picker

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The navigation bar in Microsoft Supply Chain Center shows the name of the environment that you're currently using. Some companies might use multiple environments in a tenant for Supply Chain Center. For more information, see [Sign up for a free trial](../get-started/free-trial.md).

When you select the environment name, a **Select environment** dialog box appears on the right and lists all the Supply Chain Center environments that you have access to. You can then switch to a different environment by selecting it in the list. You can use the **Search** field to quickly find specific environments.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog box lists only the following environments:
>
> - Dataverse environments where the Supply Chain Center trial is installed
> - Supply Chain Center environments that you're added to as a user

For more information about how to add users to your Supply Chain Center environment, see [Add users](add-users.md). By default, these environments are named **Microsoft Supply Chain Center Trial**. You can rename environments by using the Microsoft Power Platform admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> Ingested data, installed applications, and personal settings don't persist across environments.
