# Microsoft Supply Chain Center capabilities

This article provides an overview of Microsoft Supply Chain Center's main features. The set-up feature lets you get Microsoft Supply Chain Center ready without needing a lengthy implementation phase. Other features can be selected from the title pane and navigation pane. For more information, and some tips and tricks that can help you navigate Microsoft Supply Chain Center and all its features, see [Navigate Supply Chain Center](/get-started/navigate.md).

## Navigation pane

## Microsoft Supply Chain Center modules

Microsoft Supply Chain Center's functionality is grouped into purpose-built modules that are focused on specific areas in a supply chain lifecycle. You have the flexibility to activate as many modules as you need to meet your business needs. Upon enabling the modules, you can leverage a robust data ingestion process to compile your internal data and your suppliers' data to realize the rich functionality of Microsoft Supply Chain Center.

The following modules are currently available:

- Supply and demand insights
- Smart news
- Variety of third party modules

## Supply and demand insights

The Supply and demand insights module is enabled by default. The module shows the health of the supply chain through an analytics dashboard that is generated from internal and external data that has been ingested to Microsoft Supply Chain Center. For more information on how to start, see [Supply and demand analytics](/use/supply-and-demand.md).

## News

The **News** module provides news that may have an impact on your supply chain. The news articles can be filtered according to different categories and will show you the potential impact they may have in your supply chain. You will need to first upload your supplier's information to be able to see the news articles. For more information on setting this up, see [News](/articles/use/news.md).

## Microsoft Supply Chain Center horizontal capabilities

There are some capabilities that are always available and do not depend on the enablement of any modules. Those capabilities are found below the module menu and are grouped as follows:

- Partners
- Supplier portal
- Module library

### Partners

This section allows you to import the list of partners or create the partners that are part of your supply chain. The list of partners allows Microsoft Supply Chain Center to:

- Gather the news about your partners and display them in the **News** module
- Classify the data you ingest on behalf of those partners to enable the capabilities of other modules.
- Create data requests through the Supplier portal capability. More on this below.

### Supplier portal

Using the **Supplier portal** capabilities, you can request data from your supply chain partners to gain end to end visibility of the health of your supply chain. For more information, see [Supplier portal](/use/supplier-portal.md).

### Module library

Using the **Module Library** , you can explore and activate the modules that are available in the Microsoft Supply Chain Center. Modules focus on specific areas in the supply chain lifecycle. You have the flexibility to choose as many modules as you require to meet your business needs. Modules are provided by Microsoft and other third parties and will grow in number over time. For more information, see [Module library](/use/module-library.md).
