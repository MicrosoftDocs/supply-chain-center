# Compliance, Privacy, and Security

[!INCLUDE[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Supply Chain Center was designed with compliance, privacy, security, and confidentiality in mind. It's intended to be used to identify and mitigate risks that are related to your supply chain. To determine whether Supply Chain Center meets your compliance requirements, see the [Microsoft Supply Chain Center Terms of Service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2202072).

You have the following responsibilities:

- Inform your customers about your data processing practices. For example, disclose what data you collect and how it's used.
- Comply with all laws and regulations that are applicable to the use of Supply Chain Center. These laws and regulations include data protection laws.

## Data subject access requests

Data subject deletion requests can be completed by deleting the relevant entities within Supply Chain Center. When you respond to a deletion request, you should update the ingestion source for the entities to ensure that the data that is involved in the deletion request isn't uploaded into the application again. For more information about how to delete data, see the [Review, update, and delete your data](../administer/review-update-delete-data.md) section.

>[!Note]
> If the deleted data was originally shared with a supplier through collaboration in the Supplier portal, and the supplier exported the data, the supplier might still have the data.

## Security

Supply Chain Center might include data sharing with other users of the application. Therefore, Microsoft has implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect customer data. This data includes personal data and company data that has been copied to another region so that it can be shared with a partner that stores its data in a different location than your company. These measures are described in the Microsoft security policy that will be made available to customers, together with descriptions of the security controls that are in place for Supply Chain Center and other information that customers might reasonably request about Microsoft security practices and policies.
