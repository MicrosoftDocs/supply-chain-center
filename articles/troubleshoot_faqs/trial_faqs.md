# Supply Chain Center trial FAQ

This section answers frequently asked questions about the Microsoft Supply Chain Center trial.

## Sign-up

### What are the system requirements for the trial?

Supply Chain Center is a cloud-based service that doesn't require any special software, except an up-to-date web browser, although some restrictions apply. For the best trial experience, avoid accessing Supply Chain Center by using private browsing or Incognito mode.

### Which email address should I use to sign up?

If your company has an existing relationship with Microsoft, and you're allowed to do self-service trials, use your company email address that is associated with your organization. We'll establish your trial on your company's account.

If your company doesn't have an existing relationship with Microsoft, see **How do I sign up for the trial without an Azure AD tenant?**

### How do I sign up for the trial without an Azure AD tenant?

An Azure AD tenant is required to sign up for a Supply Chain Center trial, and if a non-Azure AD admin is signing up, your Azure AD tenant must allow for self-service trials.

### Can I sign up for multiple app trials, such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service?

Yes, you can. To view all available trials, see [Get started with a Dynamics 365 free trial](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/dynamics-365-free-trial/). You can use the same email account to sign up for different trials. However, you can't have multiple apps on the same trial site. Each trial will be on a different organization and URL. The trial data won't be shared across apps.
