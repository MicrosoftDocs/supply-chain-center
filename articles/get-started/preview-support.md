# Contact Support and Preview disclaimer 

Preview features are features that aren't complete but are made available on a “preview” basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features may have limited or restricted functionality, aren't meant for production use, and may be available only in selected geographic areas. For more information about Supply Chain Center and its preview features, see [What is Supply Chain Center](../troubleshoot-faqs/product-faqs.md).

If something isn't working as expected, you can contact Microsoft Support.

To contact Microsoft Support, follow these steps.

1. Select the help icon from the title pane in Microsoft Supply Chain Center, and then select **Contact support**. 
1. From the **Help + support** page in the Power Platform admin center, select **New support request**.
1. From the list of products, select **Microsoft Supply Chain Center**, complete, and then submit the support request.

If you have a suggestion, or you have a question, select Provide feedback from the Title pane, or visit our [community page]([https://community.dynamics.com/365/microsoft-supply-chain-center](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?partialUrl=microsoft-supply-chain-center).
