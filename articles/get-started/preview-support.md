# Preview support and disclaimer

Preview features are features that are not complete but are made available on a “preview” basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features are not supported by Microsoft Support, may have limited or restricted functionality, are not meant for production use, and may be available only in selected geographic areas. For more information about Supply Chain Center and its preview features, see [What is Supply Chain Center](../troubleshoot-faqs/product-faqs.md).

If something is not working as expected, you have a suggestion, or you have a question, select Provide feedback from the Title pane, or visit our [community page](https://community.dynamics.com/365/microsoft-supply-chain-center).
