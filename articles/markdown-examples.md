## Links

[display name](URL)

Note. DO NOT put click here, here, or some other variant in the display name. As a general rule, you want to include the full title of the target page exactly as it will appear after the link is selected. Rewrite your into sentence to make it more appropriate:

DO NOTE USE: Click here for more information.
USE: For more information, see the Asure portal.

However, depending on the target for the link, you will need to make alterations to the URL.

If you are linking to an article that is in the same GitHub folder as the one you are editing, you only need to include the filename. For example,

[Azure portal](azure-portal.md)

If you are linking to an article that is in the same doc set, but in a different folder, you need to include a relative link. For example,

[Azure portal](../azure-portal.md)

If you are linking to an article that is published on learn.microsoft.com, you need to modify the URL. 

Original URL: 
https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/metrics-content-engagement
Modified: 
[Content Engagement report](/en-us/help/contribute/metrics-content-engagement.md)

## Tables

You can do this (if it makes it easier for your to read), but it is not needed:

| **1**         | **2**         | **3**         |
| --------------|---------------|---------------|
| **row one**   | **row one**   | **row one**   |
| **row two**   | **row two**   | **row two**   |
| **row three** | **row three** | **row three** |

This is perfectly acceptable:

| **1** | **2** | **3** |
| ---|---|---|
| **row one** | **row one** | **row one** |
| **row two** | **row two** | **row two** |
| **row three** | **row three** | **row three** |

Use </br> if you need a line break within a cell.
