# Preview support
This article provides information about how to get support during Microsoft Supply Chain Center's preview.

## Preview disclaimer

Preview features are features that are not complete but are made available on a “preview” basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features are not supported by Microsoft Support, may have limited or restricted functionality, are not meant for production use, and may be available only in selected geographic areas. For more information about Supply Chain Center, [What is Supply Chain Center](/troubleshoot_faqs/product_faqs.md).
