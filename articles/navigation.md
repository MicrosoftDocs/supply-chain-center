# Navigate Windblade

This topic provides some tips and tricks so you can make the most out of navigating Windblade and all its features.

# Title pane

The title pane is always accessible to Windblade users, regardless of where they are within the application.

The title pane can be found at the very top of the page. From the title pane you can access the following features:

- **App launcher** – provides access to other Microsoft products.
- **Feedback** – lets you send feedback to the Windblade team.
- **Notifications** – lets you set up your notifications.
- **Settings** – provides access to your personal settings, the admin center, and the Power Platform admin center.
- **Help** – provides access to Windblade help resources, such as documentation and support.
- **Profile** – lets you view information about your Microsoft account or Office products.

# Navigation pane

The navigation pane is always located on the left side of the page and provides access to key features in Windblade. The hamburger icon, at the top of the navigation pane, lets you shrink or enlarge the pane.

The navigation pane has three sections:

- **Home** – provides quick access to the Windblade home page.
- **Enabled modules** – provides access to the modules you have enabled.
- **Module library and data sharing** – provides access to all of the available modules and data sharing.

# Main pages

Many main pages also contains secondary navigation components, namely breadcrumbs and pivots, to help you organize the information in different ways.

The picture below displays the **Supply & demand** module's **Supply coverage** details page that utilizes both breadcrumbs and pivots.

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs help you understand where you are within the application. Each breadcrumb represents a page you have visited, and the final breadcrumb is the page you are currently on. Breadcrumbs help organize information based on specificity. The more breadcrumbs there are, the more detailed or specific the information is.

In the sample screenshot above, the **Supply coverage** page contains more detailed information about the supply coverage KPI that is found on the **Supply & demand mismatch** page. When you have finished reviewing the **Supply coverage** , you can select the **Supply & demand mismatch** breadcrumb to return to that page.

## Pivots

Pivots are used to navigate between two or more areas of related content. The **Supply coverage** page in the picture below has two pivots: **Overview** and **AI recommendation**. **Overview** is the pivot currently being shown as noted by the underline and bold text. Select **AI recommendation** to change to that pivot.

Because many pivots are on the same page, they are based on the same level of the information hierarchy and usually provide a similar amount of detail. This contrasts how breadcrumbs show pages which increase in their specificity.
