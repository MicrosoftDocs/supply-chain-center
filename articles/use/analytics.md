# Report management

## Create new reports
### Native reports
Native reports are ones that are created within MSCC and are only visible within MSCC. To create a new, native report, go to the Analytics module, navigate to the Reports tab, and click Create in the top left corner. Choose a template and provide a name to create the new report.  Go back to the Reports tab and you can now find the new report under All reports. 

### Connected reports
Connected reports are those you have linked from your own Power BI workspace and can be accessed in both Power BI and MSCC after connecting. To link an existing workspace or a new one, an admin needs to go to the Admin settings > Analytics > Create or link a Power BI workspace.  

Once a workspace has been linked, you can connect a report from that workspace within Analytics > Reports > Connect. Unlinking a workspace will remove all connected reports from the Reports tab of the Analytics module in MSCC, but they can still be directly accessed through PBI.  

## Using existing reports
When selecting a report from the table on the Reports tab, you can edit, clone, rename, share, or delete it.  
- Editing a report allows you to update it. For connected reports, these edits will persist when you open the report from Power BI instead of MSCC. 
- Cloning a native report duplicates the report, creating a new one that is the exact same. Note that connected reports canâ€™t be cloned. 
- Renaming the report lets you change the name.
- Sharing the report provides a link you can give to others so they can also view the report.
- Deleting a report will remove it from the table in the Reports tab. This will remove native reports from PBI while connected reports will still be accessible in PBI.
