# App Browser

Companies can customize MSCC to meet their unique business requiements and goals by connecting various first and third party supply chain applications. MSCC provides an easy-to-use App Browser to search through a comprehensive list of applications and ability to get started with them quickly. 

Applications are categorized as:

1. Modules: feature rich applications that provide an interface to perform tasks and view information (examples: IOM, Smart News, Overhaul, CH Robinson)
2. Providers: applications that transform data from another source to be used by MSCC or 1P modules on MSCC (examples: FedEx, SAP, Big Commerce)
3. Connectors: applications that provide a connection to another source (examples: Snowflake, SQL, Azue Blob, SAP Hana DB)

Applications need to be approved and installed by your administrator before it is made accessible to you and the rest of your organization. Administrators can install and manage apps from the [App Management screen](articles/administer/appmanagement).

# Finding and using apps

You can access the App Browser by clicking on the "Apps" icon in the left menu. 

On top of the App Browser page are two tabs: "Installed", and "All". "Installed" is the default view, and contains all the apps that have been installed for you by your administrator. The "all" tab has all the available apps for MSCC. If you see an app that you're interested in but has not been installed for you yet, contact your administrator.

There are two sections: "Modules", and "Providers and connectors". On top of each section in the upper right is a filter control. Modules can be filtered by publisher or domain. Providers and connectors have more filters, such as which modules they connect to, or are already connected with, and status.

Modules can be opened with the "open" button on the tile. Opened modules will appear in the left navigation as an "active" app. By right clicking the app in the left navigation, you can pin the app to the menu for quick access (or unpin if you no longer want the app there). 

You can see details of all apps by clicking on the "details" button. This will provide info like a description, screenshots or videos, licensing and support links, and more.

By clicking the "manage" button on any tile, you will be taken to the App Management area to manage that app. You will need administrator rights to manage apps.

Some apps cannot be used unless a dependent app is enabled. For example, Fedex "connects with" IOM. Thus, FedEx cannot be activated until the IOM module is activated.

To use any 3p apps on MSCC, you will need a license and credentials with that 3p. Please contact those 3p companies directly to get an account.
