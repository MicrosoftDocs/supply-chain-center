# App Browser

Companies can customize MSCC to meet their unique business requiements and goals by connecting various first and third party supply chain applications. MSCC provides an easy-to-use App Browser to search through a comprehensive list of applications and ability to get started with them quickly. 

Applications are categorized as:

1. Modules: feature rich applications that provide an interface to perform tasks and view information (examples: IOM, Smart News, Overhaul, CH Robinson)
2. Providers: applications that transform data from another source to be used by MSCC or 1P modules on MSCC (examples: FedEx, SAP, Big Commerce)
3. Connectors: applications that provide a connection to another source (examples: Snowflake, SQL, Azue Blob, SAP Hana DB)

Applications need to be approved and installed by your administrator before it is made accessible to you and the rest of your organization.

# Finding and using apps



Modules are provided by Microsoft and independent software vendors (ISVs). All modules that are provided by Microsoft are enabled by default. However, a license is required to enable ISV modules. To learn more about how to enable ISV modules, see [ISV modules](isv-modules.md).

On the **Module library** page, you can view a list of all available modules, learn more about each module, and enable/disable selected modules.

To learn more about a specific module, select **View details**. The **Overview** tab shows more information about the value that the module provides, sample screenshots, or videos about the module. You can use the Details tab to learn about the data that is required to power the module, view documentation, provide feedback, and view available release notes.
