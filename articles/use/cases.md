# Create mitigation cases

Use the **Cases** module in Microsoft Supply Chain Center to capture risks and document their mitigation for future use. Although cases can be created outside the **Cases** module, previously created cases can be viewed and updated only inside the module.

## Create a case

There are multiple entry points for creating a case in Supply Chain Center. Regardless of the entry point, a dialog box appears where you describe the risk. When you've finished, select **Save** to create the case and close the dialog box.

### Create a case from Analytics reports

You can create cases directly from custom reports in the **Analytics** section of Supply Chain Center. To create a case from a single chart, first select a data point on that chart. Then select **Create a case**. To create a case from the whole report, select **Create a case** without selecting a data point. Cases that you create from **Analytics** reports contain a link to the chart or report that they were sourced from.

### Create a case from scratch

You can create a generic case from scratch by using the **Cases** module. After you select the **Cases** module, select **New case**. Because cases that you create in this way lack the context of a risk, they don't contain a link to the source that they were created from.

## View and update a case

Any user can view and update a case. Go to the **Cases** module to view the list of cases. You can use the column headers to sort the list and the search bar to search by case name. Select the **Own** tab to view cases that have been assigned to you.

After you've finished sorting and filtering the cases, select the name of a case to view it. On the **Notes** tile, you can add notes to keep track of actions and their progress. To edit the case information, select **Edit**. The dialog box that you used to create the case appears, and you can edit the information in it.
