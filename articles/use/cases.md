# Mitigation cases

Use the Cases module in Microsoft Supply Chain Center to capture risks and document their mitigation for future use. While cases can be created from outside the Cases module, already created cases can be viewed and updated from within the module.

## Create a case

There are multiple entry points to create a case within Supply Chain Center. Regardless of entry point, a sidebar with a form appears. Use the form to describe the risk and select **Save** to create the case and close the sidebar.

### Analytics reports

Cases can be created directly from custom reports in the Analytics section of Supply Chain Center. To create a case from a single chart, first select a data point on that chart then select **Create a case**. To create a case from the entire report, select **Create a case** without selecting a data point. Creating cases from Analytics reports links that case to the chart or report it was sourced from.

### From scratch

Creating a generic case from scratch can be done using the Cases module. After selecting the Cases module, select **New case**. Because these cases lack the context of a risk, they won't contain a link to the source they were created from.

## View and update a case

Any user can view and update a case. To do so, go to the Cases module to view the list of cases. Cases can be sorted using the column headers, and there is a search bar to search by a case's name. Select the **Own** tab to see cases that have been assigned to you.

After sorting and filtering cases, select the name of a case to view it. Notes to keep track of actions and their progress can be added directly in the Notes tile. To edit the case information, select **Edit**. The case sidebar appears again and the information in it can be updated.
